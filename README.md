Data and details for submitting solutions will be posted here.  Stay
tuned.

**Activity here, at the moment, is for testing
  purposes, and is not final until this message is removed**

# Logistics

1.  Teams can consist of up to 4 people.  You may add team members up
to noon EDT on 8/11 by editing your response to the google form.
2.  Teams of entirely undergraduates will be in the undergraduate
division, else they will be in the open division.
3.  Predictions on test data set are submitted by pushing to
    github.  A respository with the name `Hackathon-Summer-2020`,
    owned by the team captain, will
    be queried for a file named [prediction/prediction.csv](prediction/prediction.csv).  **If the team captain forks this
    repository and writes predictions there everything should work
    (as long as the predictions are formatted correctly).**
2.  Predictions will be scored at least once daily, starting 8/8, with
    scores posted by noon.  At
    the organizers' option, predictions may be scored more frequently
    than this.
3.  The scoreboard will be located
    [here](https://rochester-biomedical-ds.github.io/Hackathon-Summer-2020/Leaderboard.html).
    We  cannot provide support
    beyond the diagnostic output included on the scoreboard if an error is
    encountered in scoring your predictions.

# Prizes
1.  First place in each division: $300 + $50*(team size)

3.  In addition, members of teams whose submissions outperform random
    guessing will be entered into a lottery for $20 grubhub
    giftcards.  Up to 30 will be awarded.
1.  Predictions will be scored based on mean square error, lower
values are better.
